public class ChordsDemo1 {
	The first chord is the I (one) chord.

	The next chord, it must either go up or down by one (eg, from 6 to 7, or 5 to 4), or it must change to a chord which shares two tones.

	As for the 4 beats:
	Beat 1 is either a passing tone or a chord tone.
	Beat 3 is always a chord tone.
	Beats 2 and 4 are either passing tones, or a repeat of the previous chord tone from 1 and 3 respectively.

	This is returned as some type of string. Do not 'play it' within the class that creates the pattern -- feel free to use tons of 'if' statements...
