If we are making a racing game similar to Mario Kart Wii:

Core Verbs (through the mechanic of Driving):
-Movement 
-Turning (Drift)

Secondary Mechanics [technically not necessary]:
-Items (Specifically, Position-Based Rubber-banding)
-Boost Panels
-Ramps (Airtime & Gravity Calculations)
-Car Weight & Collision Calculations

Nouns [this is where artists can ¡®polish¡¯]:
-The race tracks 
-The racers


(Use engineer art to make an abstract version of the nouns)
	-Use a red plane to mark ¡®lava¡¯ or a geometric terrain 	with notes of what it is supposed to be so that if the 	project continues artists can be recruited to polish.

	-If you want to replicate a lava geyser from Mario Kart 	you make a red cylindrical shape and put in 	documentation what it is supposed to be so artists can 	add texture later.

The nice part about racing games is that polish through art is not a necessity to the game feel. Games like MOBAs and RPGs need to have abstract representations polished so that players understand what they are ¨C but racing games are more mechanically focused. Physics contribute to game feel.

3 Ways to derive something original: 
	[Subvert, Deconstruct, Combine] 
This deconstructs item systems and then combines them with the individuality of a MOBA ¨C Each ¡®character¡¯ has their own set of items to obtain through acquiring ¡®Spell Stars¡¯.
Why Spell Stars? Item boxes are a copyrighted icon from Mario Kart (Capsules Sonic, Crates Crash Bandicoot).

Also aim to make every track a ¡®cross-country¡¯ (Mt. Wario).
